    <p style="color:black;">Each weapon has a set accuracy which diminishes the longer you spray with it. There are no recoil patterns ingame, recoil is simply simulated by an expanding cone the more you shoot and a slight kick in the camera which you may have to account for depending on the weapon.</p>
	<p style="color:black;">Suppressed weapons will not illuminate the position of its shooter, which makes it useful when paired with cloak usage. The most popular suppressed weapon is the ZR68S, only available to the Assault class.</p>
		<p style="color:black;">By default, the G key allows you to drop your weapon, allowing you to pick weapons off the ground or trade weapons with another teammate.

	<fieldset style="width: 700px; float: center;">
	<p style="color:black;"> The Milso is the default sidearm of the Recon class. It boasts the same damage as the Tachi, but a pretty poor firerate, faster than the Kyla but severely outpaced by the Tachi. Its only real upside is being suppressed. That said, its still a gun, and in the right hands it can still do decent damage especially against weakened players.
	<p style="color:black;"> When using a Milso, you most likely have ran out of primary ammo or are defending yourself as a ghost carrier. Shot placement is vital, as the cycle time for the Milso leaves the enemy more than enough opportunity to retaliate. Movement to throw off the aim of your target is one strategy that can be employed. Otherwise, you have the option to scavange for a better secondary, picking up a Tachi or a Kyla as a recon can be surprisingly effective, especially as a ghost carrie.
	<p style="color:black;"> The Milso has a small little known quirk. It comes equipped with 3+1 magazines, but when the magazine counter hits 0, you can still reload a new magazine, which contains only 9 rounds instead of the standard 12. It's believed to be a developer oversight. It is also the only weapon capable of being able to shoot underwater. Not even the knife can be swung underwater.

	<fieldset style="width: 700px; float: center;">
	<p style="color:black;"> The Tachi is a semi-auto pistol capable of going full-auto as its alt-fire, and is the default sidearm of the Assault class. It boasts the same damage as the Milso, but even in semi-auto it will fire faster than the Milso. It is a viable weapon even on its own, often being the backup for many experienced assault players. It is also the most popular sidearm to use while carrying ghost.
	<p style="color:black;"> The Tachi's full-auto mode is its most famous feature, capable of dumping an entire 15 round magazine downrange in less than 2 seconds. Because of this, however, keeping your target in the crosshairs becomes extremely important as the magazine will deplete extremely fast, perhaps the fastest draining full-auto weapon in the entire game. Because of this, some Assaults may opt to simply use the Tachi in semi-auto.
	<p style="color:black;"> In competitive environments, some teams may offer to drop their Tachi to a Tachi-less player who plans on using the ghost, or to simply give them a Tachi. Using the Tachi in full-auto as a recon is a great way to continue a blitz-style attack against an enemy team, as opposed to reloading or using the wimpy milso. Supports may also find an automatic secondary to be a great asset when retreating to cover.

	<p style="color:black;"> The Kyla is a hard hitting revolver, carried by the hulking Support class. Called a "Pocket Mosok" by many, it can easily dispatch anyone across impressive ranges in a few well placed shots.
	<p style="color:black;"> Despite only having six rounds per cylinder, it can be a pretty devastating weapon in the hands of a skilled Support, or any class who happened to pick one up. Headshots can especially prove to be life threatening even to another Support. That said, its main drawbacks are the severe recoil and the accuracy loss when spam firing the Kyla. Take the time to line up the shot, and hesitate trying to harrow your Mouse 1.
	<p style="color:black;"> Using the Kyla with the Ghost is an especially effective combo. Get the read on a ping, swap to the Kyla and round the corner to snipe them. It can be more effective than it sounds.

	<p style="color:black;"> The frag grenade is a standard explosive grenade, liable to kill anyone unfortunate enough to get caught in its blast radius. Only one is carried by Assaults, but they can be picked up and used by other Assaults and classes with an empty throwable slot. As a Support, <b>be careful</b> when walking over dead Assault bodies, you may pick up a frag grenade and accidentaly mistake it for one of your smoke grenades.
	<p style="color:black;"> Frag grenades can be bounced off walls, corners, props, and just about any surface. This allows for Assault players to indirectly attack a location without exposing themselves. Some maps are known for their "prenades", where Assault players will throw their only frag grenade toward a certain location to hopefully get an early kill on an unsuspecting player. Ideally, you should carry your frag grenade later into the round, as many players will not expect a frag grenade to be in play late into the round.

	<p style="color:black;"> The Smoke Grenade is the premiere throwable of the Support class. They spawn with two smoke grenades (by default) and can use their thermal vision ability to see through the resulting smoke cloud. Said smoke clouds remain up for about 15 seconds. No other class but Support can see through the cloud of smoke, attempting to walk through it will blind the player with a grey overlay.
	<p style="color:black;"> Smokes can be picked up by other classes, despite being unable to see through them. These can be a nifty decoy device if used properly. For example, in a last man standing situation you can use smokes to trick the enemy into believing you are actually a Support and are attacking from a certain lane or choke, and use this to flank around behind an enemy position being far from where they expect you. Alternatively, smokes are a great way to bait frag grenades, as Assaults tend to blindly toss frags into smoke clouds, hoping to kill any supports sitting inside. Not only does this make Assault players waste their nade, it also tells you which direction they are.

	<fieldset style="width: 700px; float: center;">
	<p style="color:black;"> The Detpack is a remote-controlled explosive used by the Recon class. It is initially given as an unarmed block of explosive, and after a brief arming animation accompanied by a loud, recognizable sound, a player will drop this explosive on the ground and automatically equip its remote. Once this remote is activated with Mouse 1, the previously placed detpack will explode with a radius 20% larger than that of the frag grenade.
	<p style="color:black;"> It is more of a defensive tool rather than an offensive measure like the frag grenade. It can be used to set up booby traps, protect the ghost by planting a detpack directly on or nearby it, block off certain routes, and give an enemy push second thoughts about pushing when they see it on the ground. Keep in mind that <b>nobody can pick up an unplanted detpack or remove a planted detpack from its place</b>, but players can pick up the remote of the detpack from a dead recon and detonate it.
	<p style="color:black;"> Recons do have the ability to detrush with a detpack, however. Detrushing is an offensive tactic where a Recon bunnyhops toward the enemy while arming their detpack. This suicidal gambit can have extremely varying results, from simply wasting the detpack and killing yourself, or successfully jihaad bombing the enemy team. It does take some practice to get right.

	<p style="color:black;"> The MPN is a weapon available to all classes, especially to those who dip under 0 XP into the Rankless Dog rank. It deals rather weak per-shot damage which is offset by its rate of fire, just shy of the SRM's rate of fire, which can drain its 30 round magazine pretty fast. If you have other options, its strongly recommended that you use different weapons instead of this one. If you suffer from high ping, the recoil from this gun may lock your view at certain angles.
	<p style="color:black;"> If you <i>are</i> unfortunate or goofy enough to use this weapon, it can be a surprisingly decent ambush gun when used against unsuspecting enemies, especially those already weakened from prior engagements. Supports may also see a niche use with it, as their only other silenced weapons, the Mosok-S and the MX-S, are unlocked at Sergeant rank, which are extremely beneficial to a support to hide their mizzle flash when hiding in a smoke cloud.
	<p style="color:black;"> Overall, an MPN can be useful in the right hands, but it is mainly used as the "punishment" gun for a reason. If you accidentally teamkilled or suicided yourself to a Rankless Dog, you should use it as a personal defense weapon to scavange a better gun off of a fallen player.

	<p style="color:black;"> The SRM is a weapon available to all classes starting from the Private rank. It is a fast-firing P90-style SMG with a large ammo pool. Though it deals the same amount of damage as an MPN, it deals it faster and for longer. It is one of the only other "good" options for Recons, while the Assault and Support classes have access to different guns more suited for their playstyle. In a toss between the SRM and Jitte for Recons, the SRM is far more recommended for close quarters combat until reaching Corporal rank.
	<p style="color:black;"> When using the SRM, you can use spray-and-pray or short controlled bursts when dealing with contacts, though the personal favorite of many is using the BRRRRRRT to maximum effect while hopping in place. It can keep firing for quite a while even when holding down the trigger, which can be great for dealing with tanky Supports, prefiring positions or suppressing enemies. The reload doesn't take that long either, roughly 3 and a half seconds before coming back to BRRRRRT on your enemies.
	<p style="color:black;"> As far as usability goes, it does suffer some drawbacks. Like with all SMGs and sidearms, it cannot penetrate walls thicker than 8 Hammer Units (HU), and in a 1-on-1 fight it underperforms against most rifles. Its accuracy also leaves a lot to desire when fighting at range. Therefore, it mainly has its place as the first SMG a Recon can go to for its surprise element.

	<p style="color:black;"> The SRM-S is a Recon-exclusive suppressed variant of the SRM. While it does boast the same damage and ammo pool as its unsuppressed cousin, it has a severe drawback of a nearly halved firerate, even worse than the MPN. This tradeoff for a suppressor is not entirely ideal, but in the right hands it can still be used to great effect.
	<p style="color:black;"> With a long cloak timer, Recons can sit in a spot to wait for an enemy to come by, and start dumping mags at any nationalist/globalist that dare cross their path. The lack of a muzzle flash can make it hard to identify where shots are coming from. It can also be sued as an effective boom-and-zoom weapon to quickly drop an enemy and hop away before their comrades have time to react. In the hands of other classes however, its usability is rather diminished with their lack of mobility, and is therefore a pretty bad weapon to weapon swap with.
	<p style="color:black;"> In terms of Recon corporal unlocks, the Jitte-S is a lot more bang for your buck in terms of damage per round versus firerate, accuracy, and similarity to its unsuppressed counterpart. Still, the SRM-S is not to be underestimated, no matter which end is pointed toward you.

	<p style="color:black;"> The Jitte is an oddly shaped yet iconic SMG available to all classes. It fits an odd niche for an SMG, as compared to the MPN and the SRM the Jitte performs almost functional to an assault rifle, comparable to a ZR68C. 
	<p style="color:black;"> It has the best accuracy of all the SMGs and has the second lowest SMG fire rate, just barely faster than the SRM-S. It's mainly used for more tactical plays rather than shock and awe. Its as close to an assault rifle as Recons can get until their first and only AR unlock of the ZR68C at Sergeant. It should be noted that it does have a lower speed penalty compared to the ZR family, so it can be an interesting choice for Assaults who wish to move faster without compromising their combat effectiveness by equipping their Tachi or knife.
	<p style="color:black;"> Even though the Jitte performs like an Assault Rifle, it does not deal as much damage as any weapon in the ZR family, but it can deal ZR damage against Recons, and as such could be employed effectively inside Recon-popular zones, like Threadplate vents. It could be considered a lightweight carbine, without the offensive benefits of an Assault Rifle.

	<p style="color:black;"> The S-Jitte, which is called Jitte Scoped in the game files for some reason, is the Recon-exclusive suppressed variant of the standard Jitte. Whether its due to developer oversight or intentional, there is <b>virtually no drawback to the suppressor</b>, making it a <i>direct upgrade to the Jitte</i>.
	<p style="color:black;"> While it still has the same damage output and fire rate as its unsuppressed cousin, the addition of a suppressor allows for even more tactical and situational play for Recons who value accuracy over volume of fire, while wishing to remain concealed.
	<p style="color:black;"> When deciding between the SRM-S and the S-Jitte, many Recons opt for the S-Jitte for its suppressed damage output that can be comparable to the ZRC. Still, it does underperform when faced against actual assault rifles, especially considering the only class which can spawn with an S-Jitte has less of a health pool. Despite this however, given the Recon's aptitude for getting the jump on unaware players, a few well aimed shots to the head on an oblivious player is more than enough to bring them down before they are given a chance to react, which would have been more difficult to do with the standard Jitte. The S-Jitte can optionally be traded up to a Support for an MX to give them suppressor advantage in smoke with decent enough firepower, and the Recon the rawdog firepower of the MX.

	<p style="color:black;"> The SUPA-7 is a shotgun which is available to all classes, albeit at varying rank requirements. It comes with three slug rounds as an alternate fire, loaded into the chamber so long as there is an empty round in the tube. It is infamously known for its wildcard hit registration, being quote, "A pop gun or a fucking flak cannon" <i>(Wahaha, 2017)</i>. It is also known for being absolutely useless against targets behind glass or a very thin wall.
	<p style="color:black;"> Despite its setbacks, the SUPA is still a solid choice for players planning on encountering targets in a close quarters environment. While an assault rifle or an SMG takes several shots to take down a target, depending on how many of the SUPA's 8 pellets hit the target it can bring down an Assault or Recon in one shot, Recons especially. Supports only need one more additional shot. Center mass shots are key, as it will always guarantee more pellets will hit the target as opposed to going for headshots.
	<p style="color:black;"> Even though shotguns are inherently meant for close quarters, the SUPA can surprisingly hit shots from farther distances and still deal considerable damage. This makes Slugs considerably nullified, especially given the fact that they take an extra second to load and flamboyantly rack. The slug borrows its damage values from the Kyla, and functions near identical to a Kyla with a lengthy reload-shoot fire rate. Supports may be more inclined to switch to their secondary instead of taking the time to load and aim a slug if considerable range is needed.
	<p style="color:black;"> As mentioned earlier, the SUPA has a huge drawback of being unable to penetrate glass or props, which can make using it in some areas or even maps a difficult task. It may be advised to forego the SUPA entirely when needing to play in these areas/maps, or at the very least pick up a different weapon from a fallen player.
	<p style="color:black;"> In the hands of a Recon, whether they reach Lieutenant or trade with an Assault or Support, they can be a devastating nightmare as they rush forward and catch their enemy completely off guard. Of course, one can simply fight fire with fire, and use another SUPA to stop the rushing recon dead in their tracks.

	<p style="color:black;"> The AA13 is an Assault-exclusive automatic combat shotgun, which can be terrifying up close and can completely and utterly destroy any obstacle in its path (So long as its not made out of glass)
	<p style="color:black;"> Assaults can only obtain the AA13 at the Lieutenant rank. No aiming is really necessary with the AA13, hipfiring is just fine. However, it still suffers the same issue as the SUPA in that it cannot penetrate unbreakable glass or props, so a smart player can easily shield themselves with a window or door when faced against an AA13. Therefore, this weapon should only be used in areas with minimal amounts of glass.
	<p style="color:black;"> When using the AA13, it may be tempting to spray with it, but the long reload time will easily discourage that. An observant enemy may also count the 16 recognizable shots you have in the magazine, and pounce the moment it clicks or you stop firing. Therefore, it is recommended you treat it like a Mosok, tapfiring in the general direction of your enemy.
	<p style="color:black;"> Compared to the only other shotgun in the game, the AA13 deals significantly weaker single shot damage as opposed to the SUPA-7, but it more than makes up for it with an insanely fast fire rate. Keep in mind that there are less pellets in an AA13 round compared to a SUPA-7 round, which means there is less chances for each pellet to hit its target. Therefore, spray-and-pray is the name of the game when in close quarters.

	<p style="color:black;"> The ZR68C is an assault rifle which is available to all classes, though Recons only unlock it at Sergeant rank. It is a decently average weapon, capable of taking down a full health Recon or Assault in mere moments, thanks to its rapid fire rate, the fastest out of all the assault rifles. Unfortunately, the ZR68C is overshadowed by numerous better options, and only sees situational use. Assaults have access to the far superior ZR68S, and Supports will use it up until Corporal class, if they aren't using the SUPA, where they will unlock the beastly MX.
	<p style="color:black;"> Despite there being better options, the ZR68C can still be a workhorse when put toe-to-toe with its competitors. Being the 4th fastest firing weapon in the game, with decent damage to boot, it can out-DPS several weapons in head-on engagements, so long as you shoot first. One advantage it has over its most popular cousin, the ZR68S, is that it has a higher penetration limit, capable of penetrating walls that are 8HU thick.
	<p style="color:black;"> In the hands of a skilled Recon, a ZRC can act like an upgraded SRM, ideal for blitz style attacks and quick boom-and-zoom engagements if the Recon does not mind being exposed via muzzle flash. Alternatively, a ZRC is a viable trade weapon for weapon swapping with a generous Assault or Support, who can give you a variety of weapons while not compromising their own damage output with the likes of early Recon weaponry.

	<p style="color:black;"> The ZR68S is the patron saint of all Assaults everywhere, being able to spawn with it right out of the gate. Viable even up against Lieutenant players, it deals reliable damage despite being suppressed, easy to handle, and accurate for long distances. The suppressor allows for Assaults to change between covert and overt combat without compromising their damage output. 
	<p style="color:black;"> The ZR68S is infamous for dealing <i>more</i> single shot damage than its unsuppressed counterpart. One theory as to why this is simply believes that the weapon scripts for the ZR68C and the ZR68S were mistakenly swapped, another states that the ZR68S was originally intended to have a three-round burst, but when the developers could not implement such a mechanic to the weapon they never readjusted the values back to how they originally were.
	<p style="color:black;"> Overall, the ZR68S is the most utilitarian weapon in the game. Envied by the other classes it is not an uncommon sight to see a Recon or Support drop their weapons to pick one up. In the hands of a Support it can be especially dangerous when paired with smokes as the suppressor will not illuminate the smoke cloud when fired, and Recons can use their speed and mobility to use this weapon to its fullest ability. One thing that you should note about the ZR68S is that it cannot penetrate walls above that are over 4 HU thick, making its penetration on par with that of SMGs.

	<fieldset style="width: 700px; float: center;">
	<p style="color:black;"> The MX is the popular and strived for workhorse of the Assault and Support classes. Recons unfortunately cannot spawn with the MX, or any weapon from the MX family, and has to trade or kill for one. It is loud, angry, and can completely decimate any class in a short well aimed burst. Its distinct firing sound will give even the most seasoned NT veteran pause.
	<p style="color:black;"> The MX is more suited for quick, dirty close range engagements. Compared to the ZR family it is less accurate in bursts, and the MX has very visible tracers which can be easily traced back to its shooter. A fast-moving Recon would flank their position to kill its user and steal it for themselves, Assaults will barrage the area with frags and Supports will smoke off the entire lane to mitigate their position. Therefore, use the MX knowing that the enemy will quickly recognize where you are, and avoid using it at longer ranges where possible.
	<p style="color:black;"> Supports can get the MX relatively early into a map, only needing 4 points to reach Corporal rank to achieve it. This makes Support players a lot more dangerous to face head-on, as they will tank any damage thrown their way and dish out even deadlier damage against their opponent. Competitive teams often switch to Support when reaching Corporal to give the "Early MX" to a different player. Assaults need to reach the Sergeant rank to spawn with it, but can make great use out of it with their mobility and cloak to make a sudden sneak attack against anyone who registers on their motion vision.

	<p style="color:black;"> The MX Suppressed (MXS for short) is the suppressed variant of the MX, available to Assaults and Supports at the Sergeant rank. Compared to the MX, it deals significantly less damage, but still a little more damage than the ZR68S. It can be a tactical choice for those who like to sit and wait for their targets to come close, as the suppressor will hide all muzzle flash from the gun. Even though it is the highest damaging suppressed weapon in the game, it is uncommon to see it in play. For one reason or another, when given the option most players will pick the MX over the MX-S.
	<p style="color:black;"> Being the only other suppressed weapon of the Support capable of full-auto fire that doesn't completely suck, it is a nice choice for Supports who like to sit in their smoke clouds, as the lack of a muzzle flash won't light up the smoke cloud. However, raw damage output is still important to many people, which makes it an uncommon pick for Supports.
	<p style="color:black;"> Recons on the other hand can make excellent use of the MX-S, if they have something substantial to trade for it. Their long cloak time is more than enough to dump an entire magazine into a group of enemies and flee. Despite sounding slower, it still boasts the same ROF as its unsuppressed cousin.

	<p style="color:black;"> The PZ is the sole unique unlock of the Support class, obtainable at Lieutenant rank. It boasts the highest magazine size of the game, but other than that it slows down its user considerably and deals damage that is slightly better that the ZR68C. This is coupled with its strong recoil which can be amplified at higher ping. Still, it isn't designed for direct engagements, but for suppression.
	<p style="color:black;"> A PZ user can hold down a chokepoint for a good 8-10 seconds before needing to reload. This can allow your teammates to flank around a location while your enemy remains pinned down, afraid to engage you head-on. This is purely psychological, however, as a smart player will know that they could theoretically win a head-on PZ vs MX engagement if they play their cards right. Therefore, you should only use the PZ while behind cover or behind a smoke cloud (Never use inside a smoke cloud as your actual location can be easily triangulated by the muzzle flash and the tracer rounds).
	<p style="color:black;"> Despite its several drawbacks, it could still be employed as a 100 round assault rifle. Recons by default cannot equip the PZ, but Bonahnsa has a plugin which allows Recons to pick up the PZ. Just keep in mind that there is a severe speed debuff with the PZ, the heaviest in the game. Recons might not feel it, but Assaults will. It can be pretty accurate so long as you burst fire and resist the urge to BRRRRRT.

	<p style="color:black;"> The Mosok is a semi-auto DMR meant for medium to long range engagements. Available to all but the Recon, it gives the Assault and Support long range capabilities early into the game. Its hampered fire rate compared to closer range options makes it difficult for CQB, therefore it is best that you switch to your sidearm if things become too close for comfort; most guns can get three to four shots off on the Mosok after it fires one.
	<p style="color:black;"> Even though it is accurate at long ranges, the Mosok can quickly lose accuracy when fired as "fast as possible". There is a brief reset time before the accuracy resets, which lasts about half a second and can easily be entered into a rhythm once practiced. Keep in mind that the muzzle flash will make you easier to spot at long range compared to its suppressed counterpart.
	<p style="color:black;"> Supports can make good use out of the weapon by standing further back from their smoke and using it to snipe anyone who crosses their sightline. The muzzle flash won't illuminate the smoke cloud if they stand back from it. Assaults can reach a decent sniping position very quickly on several maps as well. 
	<p style="color:black;"> That said, despite being made for long range engagements it can still be outpaced with most assault rifles at medium ranges, which can pepper you with considerable damage once the enemy gets a bead on you. Therefore, its suggested to swap positions once the enemy knows your location, especially when faced against Recons as they can outgun you with higher ROF weaponry.

	<p style="color:black;"> The Mosok Silenced is the suppressed variant of the standard Mosok. It trades a decreased ROF and damage for a suppressor. Available to all classes, being the Recon's only other Lieutenant unlock, it can be a decent choice for those who wish to do stealth sniping, as it is the only long range weapon with a suppressor.
	<p style="color:black;"> Delayed tapfire is still the name of the game, but the brief delay for accuracy is a little longer due to the dereased ROF. Therefore, to make each shot count you should be aiming for the head or torso. If you remain undetected by the enemy, it shouldn't be a difficult task, especially as a Recon which has access to a multitude of higher elevated spots as opposed to Assaults and Supports on top of an extended cloak timer. Just keep in mind that the moment you start firing, your enemy will try to take cover, so take them only when they feel comfortable and far away from any cover.

	<p style="color:black;"> The ZR68L is the sniper variant of the ZR68 family of rifles. Available only to the Recon, it is second only to the SRS in terms of sniper rifles. Though it fires slower than the Mosok family, it makes up for it by including a scope and higher per-shot damage. It is the only other long range option the Recon has other than the M41S.
	<p style="color:black;"> The ZR Long, as it is colloquially known, can be a solid option for early sniping, as it only requires a Recon to be Corporal rank. Recons can use their climbing advantage to hold higher elevated positions in certain maps such as Skyline. Even close range it can sometimes be surprising how much damage a single well-placed shot can do to an enemy. However, keep in mind that it takes about half a second to be able to fire another shot, and a delay has to be considered to retain its accuracy as it can diminish when trying to fire as fast as possible.
	<p style="color:black;"> The ZRL can actually be an effective counter against the SRS, if you manage to spot the sniper before they spot you. Your higher ROF over them can allow you to place two quick shots to their head before they have time to react. If they spot you, quickly bhop away to an alternate position to make it harder for them to hit you.

	<p style="color:black;"> The SRS is the king of long range engagements, as well as short range. Capable of dropping any class in one or two shots at any range, everyone knows to hide when they hear its signature report ring out across the map, lest they literally lose their head.
	<p style="color:black;"> Available only to Assaults of the Lieutenant rank, when paired with motion vision it makes them a deadly long-range sentry if they can aim well. Supports can tank a single SRS round to the head, but that is it. When shooting an enemy with their side facing toward you, it is possible to shoot them "twice" with one shot, by shooting through the arm and through the torso, though it is somewhat difficult to pull this off.
	<p style="color:black;"> Still, the SRS does not come without its drawbacks. Having only five rounds in a magazine, coupled with needing to cycle the bolt each shot, it is the slowest firing weapon in the game. The bolt cycle can be mitigated by pressing your quickswap bind twice, but it still makes follow-up shots difficult as opposed to the ZRL. Your enemies can time each shot you take with being able to move momentarily, letting them inch closer to your sniping spot.
	<p style="color:black;"> The SRS can be extremely powerful in long range maps such as Shrine and Redlight, but expect your enemy to know this too and avoid long range areas when you (or anyone) reaches Lieutenant rank.
