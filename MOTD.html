<h4>Rules:</h4>
<li>1: No intentional Teamkilling</li>
<li>2: No sitting in spectator when you don't like a map</li>
<li>3: No being a dick, i.e. no direct verbal or intentional malicious insults against others.</li>
<li>4: No loud/annoying micspam or chat spam, or you will be gagged/muted. Renaming yourself after beging gagged, or continuing your behavior when muted will warrant a tempban.</li>
<li>5: Be nice/helpful to newcomers</li>
<li>6: Do not advertise, harass or otherwise ask pubbers playing in the server to pug, <b>or</b> ask everyone to play on a different server. You will be tempbanned from both pub and pug servers.</li>
<li>7: When going AFK, please add an [AFK] tag to your name and go to spectator. AFK players sitting idle in spawn will be kicked.</li>
<li>8: No Specstacking, defined as swapping to spectator, waiting for someone on the opposite team to get autobalanced, and joining that team. It does not matter if your friend is on that team or if you just like one team.
<li>9: Intentionally making the ghost unplayable (i.e. throwing it off buildings or disconnecting while holding it) will make you subject to punishment.</li>
<li>10: Absolutely <b>NO Ghost Hopping</b>, no matter the distance, speed, or if you only chained three jumps. You will be banned.</li>
<li>11: Do as admins ask, no matter what. This includes complying with mutes/gags/renames. Disconnecting and rejoining after a mute/gag or changing your name back to what it was before an admin renamed you will make you subject to punishment.</li>
<br>

People with VAC bans are one a <b>one strike</b> policy. Any rule violation will be met with a permaban. No ifs, buts, or "it was just a trade ban" excuse. If you are found to have an alternate account with a VAC ban which was used to play on BonAHNSa, you will also be held accountable for it.</li>
<br>
<br>
Cheating via external programs or clients (Aimbots and wallhacks) will make you subject to your IP address being published.
<i>This does not include external scripts which enhance player performance, such as scripts found on our mod page.</i> <br>
If you disagree with, or believe you cannot follow the rules listed above, you are encouraged to disconnect or not play at all.<br>
<b>By connecting, playing and continuing to play on BonAHNSa, you agree to follow these simple rules, and acknowledge that admins can and will deliver punishments and penalties for failure to follow any one. Ignorance of these rules is not an excuse for breaking them. Permabans on the pub server will also apply to Bonahnsa's PUG server.</b>
<br>
<h4>SPRAY RULES:</h4>
<li>No (hard) porn, blatant offensive imagery, gore, or anything you know shouldn't be sprayed. In short, the 'limit' is anything you would see on Redlight.</li>
<br>
=====================<br>
<h4>Commands</h4>
<b>!radio</b>: Plays the NEOTOKYO soundtrack<br>
<b>!nominate</b>: Allows you to pick a map for the voting cycle<br>
